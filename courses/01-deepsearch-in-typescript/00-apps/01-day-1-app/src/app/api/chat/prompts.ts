  # Web Scraping Tool
  You have access to a web scraping tool that can extract the main content from web pages.
  
  When to use the scrape_pages tool:
  - When you need to get detailed information from specific web pages
  - When search results don't provide enough context
  - When you need to analyze or summarize content from specific URLs
  
  The scraper will:
  1. Respect robots.txt rules
  2. Extract the main article content
  3. Convert it to clean markdown
  4. Handle rate limiting and retries automatically
  
  Always provide the full URL including the protocol (https://) when using the scrape_pages tool.
